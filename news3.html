		<h2>RIMAC C_TWO PROTOTYPES INITIATED</h2>
		<div id="news_gallery">

			<figcaption>We are thrilled to introduce the world to 1,914 horsepower and 2,300 Nm of unmatched Rimac drivetrain and future driver technologies packed in an exclusive hypercar.<figcaption></figure>

		<div class="news">
			<p>Following years of development and detailed computer simulations by the engineering team at Rimac, we are proud to share the Rimac C_Two prototype testing program on tracks and in testing facilities around the world. The first batch of prototypes is undergoing vehicle dynamics, powertrain, passive safety and crash tests since spring 2019, pushing components such as tires and suspension to the limit.</p>
			<p>The tests will benefit further development and fine-tuning of components before entering the pre-production phase in early 2020. A total of 17 prototypes will be made, each with different testing purposes, from chassis rigidity to high-performance autonomous driving development.</p>
            <p>Tests will continue as the C_Two builds up to its production-car unveiling at the Geneva Motor Show in March before customer deliveries begin at the end of next year. We are excited to announce that we will be unveiling the production-specification version of the C_Two at the 2020 Geneva International Motor Show. That model will differ from the concept versions you've seen previously in 2018 and 2019 with improvements in design, ergonomics, and performance. Together with the understanding of the term "concept", the name "C_Two" will be replaced by the production model name.</p>
