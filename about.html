		<h1>About Rimac Automobili</h1>
		<h2>Making the future exciting</h2>

		<p>Rimac Automobili was founded with the vision to create the sportscar of the 21st century. Soon it was clear that we first had to invent various technologies to make this possible and that those technologies could do much more. Today, we are unleashing the full potential of Nikola Tesla’s invention, the alternating current electric motor, in many ways and industries.</p>
		<p>The Concept_One achieves today what many wouldn’t consider achievable even in the future. It shows that the future of transportation is not boring or slow but fun and better in every way. It takes the fear of the future away and makes us excited and awaited. Now think about all that technology applied in many other products and applications across different industries, driving the change towards a time beyond fossil fuels.</p>
		<p>Today, Rimac numbers around 500 people at locations on the outskirts of Zagreb, in Split, Osijek and Joint Venture in China. The company's core competencies are in the design, development, and production of all-electric hypercars and high-performance electrification components for our partners in the automotive industry. From a sketch on paper to the finished car, Rimac is where everything happens.</p>
		<p>We at Rimac are working on the most innovative technology in the automotive industry, designing, engineering, and manufacturing it in-house and from scratch.</p>
		<p>We are just getting started. Join us as we continue to grow and bring exciting products to the market.</p>
